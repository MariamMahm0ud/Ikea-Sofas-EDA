Ikea Sofas EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Overview
This project aims to gather data on Ikea's sofa products through web scraping using Selenium, followed by an in-depth analysis and visualization of the product attributes and prices using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Technologies Used
Web Scraping: Selenium
Data Analysis: Python, Pandas
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Features
Web Scraping: Automated data collection from Ikea's website to gather information on sofa products.
Data Cleaning: Pre-processing and cleaning of scraped data to ensure accuracy.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing and exploring the data to derive insights on product attributes, trends, and pricing.
Data Visualization: Creating visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to represent the analyzed data effectively.
Data Collection
We used Selenium for web scraping to collect data on Ikea's sofa products, including product names, prices, and other attributes, directly from the website.

Data Analysis & Visualization
The collected data was analyzed and visualized using Python's Pandas library for data manipulation, Matplotlib for basic plotting, and Seaborn for more advanced visualizations.

Future Improvements
Implementing machine learning models to predict product demand or prices.
Enhancing the dashboard with interactive visualizations using Plotly or Dash.
